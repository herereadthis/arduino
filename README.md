#### Components

- **Transducer** - components that change one type of energy into electrical energy, or vice versa.
  - **Sensor** - things that convert other forms of energy into electrical energy.
  - **Actuator** - things that chance electrical energy into other forms of energy.

#### Electrical circuits

- **Current** - the amount of electrical charge flowing past a specific point in your circuit, measured in amps (**A**)
- **Voltage** - the difference in energy between one point in a circuit and another, measured in volts (**V**)
- **Resistance** - how much a component resists the flow of electrical energy, measured in ohms (**Î©**)
